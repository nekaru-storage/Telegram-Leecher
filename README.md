## **🦉 Problems**

 - You need to be aware of Runtime Disconnections
 - Limited Disk Storage in Free Colab Account ~84 GB 
 <!-- - Which Limits the zip process of files size to ~41 GB
 - Have to manually upload config files ( token.pickle, thmb.jpg, etc ) -->

## **🪲 Known Bugs**

 - Video Splitting is not supported  yet
 - Unzipleech only supports '.zip' files, thus can't extract rar, tar or 7z files till now
 - Links are only taken from Notebook. Bot Commands are not available till now

## **🚨 NOTE:**
 - Magnet or Torrent Links are supported, But avoid using because `Google Colab Stricly Prohibits Torrents`

## **⚠️ You Should NOT use it as it goes against Google Colab's Policy**

> Resources in Colab are prioritized for interactive use cases. We prohibit actions associated with `bulk compute`, actions that negatively impact others, as well as actions associated with bypassing our policies. The following are disallowed from Colab runtimes:
>- file hosting, `media serving`, or `other web service offerings not related to interactive compute with Colab`
>- `downloading torrents` or `engaging in peer-to-peer file-sharing`
>- using a remote desktop or SSH
>- connecting to remote proxies
>- mining cryptocurrency
>- running denial-of-service attacks
>- password cracking
